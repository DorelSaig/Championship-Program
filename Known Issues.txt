Known Issues:
1. There's no indication for the final score of each match. Option to add in the future.
2. There's no way to change/edit participant name after hitting the "add participant" button.
3. At the Overtime views and at the penalties view the name of the participants is not shown.
4. If an exception is thrown in the tennis game, the program will be closed in order to reset the game score and user required to start over again.

No more bugs that I found.
